This framework has 2 parts, a server that serves static content such as apache, lighttpd, or nginx, and a server that serves the active content, the python backend. 
The function that passes requests from the client to the server is in the requests.js file and needs to be modified to fit your enviroment. 
The api calls you can define are defined in server/calls/ directory. 

Here is an walkthrough of the workflow

client side:
onclick event triggers js function which triggers the requests.js->request(call) function. The call variable gets requested from the api server. 

server side:
server.py->Server() recieves an HTTP request. it strips everything off of it except the call. server.py->Server() then calls api.py->apiCall(call). 
api.py->apiCall(call) looks in the server/calls/ directory for a python file with the same name as the call function. It then calls that function with the rest of the 
call passed in as variables. 


call definition:
http://someHost:somePort/functionName&input1&input2

Calls are seperated by the ampersand character.
