# pyAPI
Basic web framework for non web programmers

*Currently in Alpha*

How to use:
1. Modify main.py and request.js to reflect the server and port you will be using for the API backend. 
2. Run run.sh
3. Browse to the host hosting the client/ folder
4. Press the test button. It should read with the current server time. 
5. Read more about developing applications for this framework in help.txt

What it does:
1. Provides an API server that translates HTTP requests responses to and from python scripts
2. Provides a Javascript function to make requests to the API server

In essence, this framework provides the glue between python scripts running on a server and client web browsers.

What it does not do:
1. Assist in developing front end HTML, CSS, or Javascript
2. Assist in developing back end Python.

Road Map:
1. Configuration files
2. TLS/HTTPS support
3. Threading and multi-processing
